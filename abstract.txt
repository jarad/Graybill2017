RNAseq data comprise a set of counts for G genes on a set of N samples. The counts are positively associated with the expression levels of mRNA of particular genes. Since G is typically much larger than N, we construct a hierarchical overdispersed count regression model that borrows information across genes. We estimate the high-dimensional posterior using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that utilizes a step-out slice sampler whenever Gibbs steps are unavailable. We implemented our approach in a set of three R packages: fbseq, fbseqOpenMP, and fbseqCUDA. The fbseq package provides a user interface to the two backends. The fbseqOpenMP backend provides an implementation that is parallelized across CPU cores and is therefore useful for testing. The fbseqCUDA backend provides an implementation on a NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and therefore is suitable to analysis of realistic data sets. The GPU version provides a million iterations of the sampler in a couple of hours with computation time scaling linearly in the number of genes and the number of samples.
